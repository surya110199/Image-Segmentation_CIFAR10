# Image segmentation using kmeans and spectral clustering.

This project is mainly about a comparative analysis for performing image segmentation on the CIFAR-10 dataset using K Means and Spectral Clustering techniques.

## Dataset:-
For this project, I only used three classes namely Airplane, Deer, and Horses of the CIFAR-10 dataset. The segmented images can be found in the report_images folder.

## Code Description:-
1) The raw data can be found under the Data Folder. I extracted Airplane, deer, and horse images and stored them in .npy files.
2) K means.py is the code for Image segmentation using K means Clustering
3) weights.py is the code for generating weights for the Adjacency matrix using Shi-Malik and Ng-Spectral clustering.
4) spectral_clustering.py is the code for spectral clustering.

# How the code works:-
For kmeans:- Run Kmeans.py
