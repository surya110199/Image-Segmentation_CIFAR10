#Image segmentation using kmeans and spectral clustering.

This project is mainly about a comparative analysis for performing image segmentation on the CIFAR-10 dataset using K Means and Spectral Clustering techniques.

## Dataset:-
For this project, I only used three classes namely Airplane, Deer, and Horses of the CIFAR-10 dataset. The segmented images can be found out under report_images folder.
